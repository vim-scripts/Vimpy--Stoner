Bundler Required
================

In order to use Vimpy, you must first install Pathogen or
Vundle. Vimpy must be installed within a bundle in order to
work correctly. This is because it leverages the organizational
structure provided by bundles in order to set up Python modules.

You can find more information about these projects at the following
